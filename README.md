# Says You!

A simple "Simon Says" game.

The player is shown a random sequence of single-digit numbers and must match them to pass the round.

The difficulty escalates in the amount of numbers in the sequence, the speed of their appearance, and the length of the numbers. They can be single-digit, double-digit etc.

Expert players will start to see colors in later rounds.

Basic prototype to begin with.

Got basic UI and random numbers working.

22 Oct 2025
version 1.0 done - game is basically working:

- player starts game
- game shows random sequence of numbers
- player must match sequence
- player wins if they match sequence
- player loses if they don't match sequence
- game ends when player loses
- score is updated when player wins
- difficulty escalates in the amount of numbers in the sequence & the speed of their appearance

No visual UI work done yet - all runs in basic HTML elements in the browser.

Next steps:

- add visual UI
- add colours to numbers
- add difficulty levels
- add visual timer
- add bonus 'see again' feature the player can use to see the sequence again before they start to answer; this can be earned back by winning a set number of rounds
- add scoring system
- add game over screen
- add high score system
- add music
- add sound effects, e.g. for correct/incorrect responses and individual numbers 0-9.

Notes:

- will always be single-digit numbers
- will always start with 3 numbers
- exact way difficulty escalates to be determined

Targets:

- keep it simple
- all in one script
- no external dependencies
- no libraries
- no frameworks

Timeframe:

- 3 days - version 2.0 done 25 Oct 2025
