# Says You!

A simple "Simon Says" game.

The player is shown a random sequence of single-digit numbers and must match them to pass the round.

The difficulty escalates in the amount of numbers in the sequence, the speed of their appearance, and the length of the numbers. They can be single-digit, double-digit etc.

Expert players will start to see colors in later rounds.

Basic prototype to begin with.
